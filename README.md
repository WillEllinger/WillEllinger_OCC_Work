# WillEllinger_OCC_Work
This is a repository I am using to showcase some of the work I have been doing while working at the OCC lab at Temple.

The notebooks and datasets in this repository are not used in the paper I am currently co-authoring. Once the paper is published the notebooks and code will be added to provide a more in-depth view of the work I've completed.
